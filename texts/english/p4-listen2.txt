	•	My name is Vet Vivian, and I love animals! My job is to take care of animals by keeping them healthy. I work with animals like hamsters, rabbits, dogs, and cats. Pet owners bring their animals to my clinic when they need help. I examine the animals and make sure they are well and healthy. At times, I do attend to injured animals.
