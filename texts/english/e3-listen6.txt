Lions usually hunt at night. Their prey is usually larger and faster than them. 
Sometimes, lions eat smaller prey such as mice, birds, and tortoises.

First, the adult males eat. Then, the lionesses and cubs eat the remaining. 
Lions have huge appetites and can go for seconds shortly after their first meal.
