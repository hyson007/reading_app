The pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant that gets its nutrients by digesting insects. 
Part of the leaf of a pitcher plant is shaped like a pitcher or trumpet. 
It attracts insects with its sweet nectar. 
Once an insect crawls into the pitcher, it falls into a pool of digestive juice. 
The soft parts of the insect get digested and the plant absorbs its nutrients.
